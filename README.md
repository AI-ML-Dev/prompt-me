# Prompt Engineering: Learn, Develop, Share

This is a personal project started in May 2023 to explore the growing areas of _Generative AI_ (models, platforms) and _Prompt Engineering_ (interfaces, best practices) from theory to practice.

## Learning Objectives

 - Understand Generative AI and Large Language Models (theory)
 - Explore OpenAI, MidJourney, HuggingFace and more (platforms)
 - Learn Prompt Engineering techniques (chat-based AI/UX) 
 - Apply learnings in practical project (tbd)

## #100DaysOfPrompts

To stay accountable, I'm jumpstaring a #100DaysOfPrompts journey where I will write a blog post a day capturing my learnings or insights. Resources I will use for exploration include:
 - Reputable courses on LLM, Prompt Engineering and AI.
 - Documentation and training from relevant platform providers.
 - Books & articles from practitioners, sharing prompt engineering tips
 - Research papers from academia, focused on systems and user research.

## Website

For now, I'll be using a GitHub Pages hosted website, built on the Docusaurus platform and deployed at [https://prompt-me.dev](https://prompt-me.dev). To learn more about how the website is setup, check the [README.md](website/README.md)

Happy trAIls!
