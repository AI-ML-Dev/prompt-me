## Learning Objectives

**My goal over the next #100 days** is to:
 - understand Generative AI and Large Language Models (terms & concepts)
 - explore what OpenAI, Midjourney, Hugging Face etc. provide (platforms)
 - get hands-on experience in prompt engineering techniques (AI/UX)
 - apply the learnings in at least one practical project (to be determined)

## Motivation

Generative AI is going mainstream in 2023, with platforms like OpenAI making access to relevant models both developer-friendly and competitively-priced for exploration. 

_Prompt Engineering_ is a core part for effective usage, with different services and applications trying to guide the user in crafting more effective prompts to deliver relevant results. **For example:**
 * I generated the image below with [Microsft Bing's Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) powered by DALL-E, [(preview)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/21/create-images-with-your-words-bing-image-creator-comes-to-the-new-bing/).
 * Prompt guidance was a template with {an adjective, a noun, a verb, and a style}.
 * My prompt: _"digital art, cute 3d peacock wearing a crown and talking to a cute 3d robot"_.

However, repeating the same prompt verbatim gave different results. Even a minute change to the prompt could move the result (aesthetic, style) in a different direction. **Prompt Engineering** is about learning to improve the specificity of your request without impacting the creativity and quality of the resulting output.

Over the next 3 months or so, I hope to explore this space in a more hands-on way by tinkering with different platforms and models, playing with prompt ideas, and learning from the expertise of others.

## Resources

I hope to create a dedicated page on this site to track resources I will be using. For now I've identified **four main sources** for inspiration:
 - Online courses from reputed educators or organizations. 
 - Documentation from relevant platforms and open-source projects.
 - Published books and articles from early adopters and active practitioners.
 - Research papers from academics, exploring systems/UX ideas and challenges.

:::info WHAT'S NEXT:

I'll complete the [**ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developers**](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/1/introduction) online course from Andrew Ng and team at DeepLearning.AI. It's a short (1-hr) video series (currently free) covering usage, tips and applications for prompt engineering.
