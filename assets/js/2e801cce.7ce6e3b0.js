Even a minute change to the prompt could move the result (aesthetic, style) in a different direction. **Prompt Engineering** is about learning to improve the specificity of your request without impacting the creativity and quality of the resulting output.\\n\\nOver the next 3 months or so, I hope to explore this space in a more hands-on way by tinkering with different platforms and models, playing with prompt ideas, and learning from the expertise of others.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\nI hope to create a dedicated page on this site to track resources I will be using. For now I\'ve identified **four main sources** for inspiration:\\n - Online courses from reputed educators or organizations. \\n - Documentation from relevant platforms and open-source projects.\\n - Published books and articles from early adopters and active practitioners.\\n - Research papers from academics, exploring systems/UX ideas and challenges.\\n\\n:::info WHAT\'S NEXT:\\n\\nI\'ll complete the [**ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developers**](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/1/introduction) online course from Andrew Ng and team at DeepLearning.AI. It\'s a short (1-hr) video series (currently free) covering usage, tips and applications for prompt engineering.\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
